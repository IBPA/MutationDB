1. Notes for the folders related to ANN:
ANN_feature_selection: do backward feature selection using different hyper-parameters.
ANN_feature_selection: change one of the hyper-parameters and see how the performance change
CV_ANN: cross validation using the selected features and optimal hyper-parameters.
CV_oversampling_ANN: cross validation with the rare class oversampled.
validation_ANN: do validation on the osmotic condition. 

2. Notes for the folders related to SVM_NB:
SVM_NB_feature_selection: do backward feature selection using different hyper-parameters (no hyper-parameters for NB)
CV_SVM_NB: cross validation using the selected features and optimal hyper-parameters.
CV_oversampling_SVM_NB: cross validation with  the rare class oversampled.
validation_SVM_NB: do validation on the osmotic condition.
